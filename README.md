This is my initial foray into the world of bash scripting and using Linux as my primary OS. Linux has been an interest of mine for several years but until recently I had no desire to learn how the OS worked and relied on distrohopping rather than resolving issues.

IDK what I'm doing. 

# TODO

1. Post Install script for Fedora. 
2. ~~KDE Plasma 6 backup script~~
3. KDE Neon post install script
4. Distro Agnostic KDE config backup script
